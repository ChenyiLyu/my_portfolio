            Hello! I am Eva<span role="img" aria-label="hello">ðŸ‘‹</span>. I am currently a first year Master student at New York University, NYC. I study Data Science.

            Meanwhile, I am interested in software developing (I am seeking a Full-Stack internship position for 2022 summer!<span role="img" aria-label="rocket">ðŸš€</span>). 

            I come from a interdisciplinary engineer background; I am passionate about exploring every tech stack<span role="img" aria-label="fire">ðŸ”¥</span>.

            My aspiration of developing products that could improve every day life has always motivated me during my journey.
            
            I love travelling and hiking, and I have a long long to-go list. My favorite pastime is watching Conan Manga again and again on a cozy sofa.
